In March 2023 I attended a 2-month long React education at [Digitalna Dalmacija](https://digitalnadalmacija.hr/). The education lasted for 8 weeks, and every week I was required to build a new project. This is the project I built in the 5th week. It was the last "small" app that I built. The next week I started working on a final project in which I utilized all the React concepts I learned.

### Challenge

The task was to build a React app that stores all the information about different clothing items in a wardrobe. The user can see and edit all the existing items or add new ones. All the data is stored in a local JSON server.
